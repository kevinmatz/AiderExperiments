Attempting install on Windows, 2023-09-30:

Prerequisites:
- "pip" installed long in the past; "pip" does not work on command line though, so need to use "python -m pip"
- Chocolately and Anaconda previously installed

https://aider.chat/docs/install.html

- Ran: "python -m pip install aider-chat"
  - but "aider" does not work on command line
  - tried "python -m pip uninstall aider-chat" and then reinstall but did not help
- Installed "universal ctags" to work with repositories with multiple files:
  - "choco install universal-ctags"
  - "ctags --version" confirms it's installed
- Created C:\Users\kevin\.aider.conf.yml (i.e., in $HOME directory) with OpenAI secret key:
  - "openai-api-key: sk-..."
- Anaconda previously installed via installer, but "conda" not recognized on the command line
  - Added C:\DevTools\anaconda3\condabin to PATH, now works
- In C:\GitRepos\AiderExperiments\Test1, executed "conda create --name aider python=3.11.3" (as per advice in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df8afeb1FY8)
- "conda activate aider"
- "python -m pip install aider-chat"
- still doesn't work
  - other people have reported the same issue but the issue has been closed by the maintained without a solutioon: https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/issues/126
- "python -m pip list > pip-list.txt"
  --> "aider" does not appear in the list of installed packages

- https://saturncloud.io/blog/activating-conda-environment-from-powershell-a-guide-for-data-scientists/
  - "conda init powershell"
  - ==> For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell. <==
  - restarted PowerShell
  - now I see:

  - "C:\GitRepos\AiderExperiments\Test1> conda create --name aiderenv"
  - "conda activate aiderenv"
  
  - "python -m pip install --upgrade pip"
  - "python --version" --> "Python 3.11.3"
  
- "aider" still doesn't work

- Other people reporting the same problem on https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/issues/126 "Aider not recognized as command in Windows cmd prompt"
  - project owner/maintainer Paul Gauthier closed this issue without resolving it

--> Next step, join this Discord group to ask for help... https://discord.com/channels/1131200896827654144/1133060264825208942
  - Created a Discord account but seconds after verifying my phone number I immediately got a "Account Disabled - Violation of TOS/Community Guidelines Notification" email and cannot log in
    - submitted a support ticket to Discord... ugh...

--> OK, next step, try all over on Linux instead...
